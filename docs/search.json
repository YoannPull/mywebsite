I am doing my PhD under the supervision of Professor Christophe Hurlin. I develop robust econometric and machine-learning methods to measure new and emerging risks in credit risk. I have taught courses at the University of Orléans, the University of Bordeaux, and ENSAI.\n\n\nOn this site you’ll find my research papers and some teaching resources. You can also download my CV (PDF) and find ways to reach me on the contact page.\n\n\nResearch interests: financial econometrics; machine learning; credit risk; alternative data; emerging risks."

The primary objective is to develop a sophisticated predictive model based on discernible real estate characteristics. This model serves a dual purpose: providing insightful estimates of potential returns from real estate investments and assisting in strategic decision-making when searching for reasonably priced accommodations in various London neighborhoods."

The variables under consideration cover a range of factors, including property type, room configuration, and various amenities. To streamline the analytical process, the variables are meticulously categorized as quantitative (prefixed by “n_”), qualitative (prefixed by “f_”), and dummy variables (prefixed by “d_”), forming the foundation of an effective and nuanced predictive model."

Using insights from this preliminary analysis, we then proceed to construct various predictive models. This approach ultimately allows us to choose the optimal model, guided by the findings from our earlier analyses."
