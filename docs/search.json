The primary objective is to develop a sophisticated predictive model based on discernible real estate characteristics. This model serves a dual purpose: providing insightful estimates of potential returns from real estate investments and assisting in strategic decision-making when searching for reasonably priced accommodations in various London neighborhoods."

The variables under consideration cover a range of factors, including property type, room configuration, and various amenities. To streamline the analytical process, the variables are meticulously categorized as quantitative (prefixed by “n_”), qualitative (prefixed by “f_”), and dummy variables (prefixed by “d_”), forming the foundation of an effective and nuanced predictive model."

Using insights from this preliminary analysis, we then proceed to construct various predictive models. This approach ultimately allows us to choose the optimal model, guided by the findings from our earlier analyses."
