## Overview

This repository focuses on an in-depth case study aimed at predicting rental prices for apartments listed on Airbnb in London. The primary objective is to develop a sophisticated predictive model based on discernible real estate characteristics. This model serves a dual purpose: providing insightful estimates of potential returns from real estate investments and assisting in strategic decision-making when searching for reasonably priced accommodations in various London neighborhoods.

## Dataset Features

With a substantial dataset comprising 51,646 observations, our analysis focuses on 33 London boroughs, carefully selected as variables. The variables under consideration cover a range of factors, including property type, room configuration, and various amenities. To streamline the analytical process, the variables are meticulously categorized as quantitative (prefixed by "n_"), qualitative (prefixed by "f_"), and dummy variables (prefixed by "d_"), forming the foundation of an effective and nuanced predictive model.

## Key Metrics

- **Dataset size:** 51,646 observations
- **Variables:** 65 columns
- **Factors considered:** Property type, room configuration, amenities
- **Variable classification:** Quantitative (prefixed by "n_"), Qualitative (prefixed by "f_"), and Dummy variables (prefixed by "d_")
- **Target variable:** 'usd_price_day'

## Objective and Importance

The first step of our approach involves conducting an exploratory analysis to understand the data and evaluate the impact of different variables on the target variable. Using insights from this preliminary analysis, we then proceed to construct various predictive models. This approach ultimately allows us to choose the optimal model, guided by the findings from our earlier analyses.

## Repository Navigation

1. **Data Exploration and Insight Visualization:** Dive deep into the dataset to uncover the intricacies of the London Airbnb market.
2. **Model Construction:** Build multiple models, each undergoing parameter optimization using a validation set.
3. **Predictions:** Test the top-performing models from each category on a generalization set. The standout model from this stage will be selected.
